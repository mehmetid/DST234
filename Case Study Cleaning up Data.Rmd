## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

3. 

```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, names_to = "code", values_to = "cases", values_drop_na = TRUE)
glimpse(who1)


```

4. 

```{r}

who1 %>% 
  count(code)

```

5.

```{r}

who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(code = stringr::str_replace(code, "newrel", "new_rel"))
glimpse(who2)

```

6.

```{r}

who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(code, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
glimpse(who3)


who3 %>% 
  count(new)

```

7.

```{r}
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)

```

8.

```{r}

who5 <- who4 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who5

```

9. 

```{r}
who %>%
   pivot_longer(cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, names_to = "code", values_to = "cases", values_drop_na = TRUE) %>% 
  #mutate(code = stringr::str_replace(code, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)

```
