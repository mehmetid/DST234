```{r, setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE)
library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)
#  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
#  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
```



The first step is to load the data in your workspace.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)

# PRELIMINARY STEPS:
# 1. Download the file Miniproject 2 data to your R workspace. This will be a file called "athlete_events.csv".
# 2. Import in the file into your workspace, using the following code:
olympic_data <- read_csv("athlete_events.csv")

# NOTE: you may need to adjust this somewhat depending on where the file is located on your computer.

# Once you have the data in your workspace then glimpse it
glimpse(olympic_data)

```
